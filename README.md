# 2D Platformer 🎮

A Unity-based 2D platformer project to showcase my game development progress and skills.  
This repository tracks my step-by-step journey as I build mechanics, polish gameplay, and learn best practices for Unity and C#.

---

## ✅ Current Features
- ✔️ Player movement (walk, run, jump, push, throw)
- ✔️ Configurable speeds & jump height directly from **Character Inspector**
- ✔️ Animations now auto-load from **Resources folder** (no manual inspector setup)
- ✔️ Character data handled via **ScriptableObjects** for clean modular design
- ✔️ Enemy AI with patrol, chase, and attack states
- ✔️ Idle / rest logic for both player and AI
- ✔️ Feet collider for grounded detection
- ✔️ Blocks and ground layers properly configured
- ✔️ Modular **Canvas/UI** and level stages packaged as a separate Unity package

---

## 🎯 Next Goals
- Add enemy projectile throw mechanics  
- Expand patrol/attack animations for smoother combat  
- Build out level design with traps & hazards  
- Introduce collectibles, scoring system, and checkpoints  
- Refine stage streaming/transition system

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Unity 2022.3.20f1  
- C# scripting  
- Git + GitHub for version control

## 💡 Notes
This project is being developed incrementally.  
Each commit documents new features, fixes, or experiments.  

The aim is to demonstrate:
- Consistent progress  
- Clean coding practices  
- Growing game design understanding  

This repo is also part of my **portfolio and employment journey**, showing how I evolve mechanics and structure over time.
